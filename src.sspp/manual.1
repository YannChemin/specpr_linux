NAME
	sspp - Selective Soruce Pre-Processor

SYNOPSIS
	sspp -strings filename
	sspp -r -strings filename
	sspp -c -strings filename
	sspp -f -strings filename

DESCRIPTION
	This program compares strings in the file "filename" and if
a match is found, deletes the string from the line.  Each string
must be at the beginning of a line.  The result is written to the
standard output.  You can specify more than one string.

OPTIONS
	strings: any number of strings (one is required) of one or
more characters in length.  Each string must have a "-" in front of
it.

        -r   Ratfor mode
        -c   C mode
        -f   Fortran Mode

             In these modes, sspp appends/prepends the appropriate
             comment characters for that language.  For example:

                         sspp -r -XWIN test.r

             would strip out strings #XWIN.  The -c option searches
             for "/*string" and "string*/" while the -f option
             searches for the strings "cstring" or "Cstring", where
             "string" is any character string.

EXAMPLES
	Sspp can be used to select machine dependant code.  For
example, the following is a sample from a makefile.  First, a get is
done to get the current version of the source, then sspp selects
machine dependent code from the ratfor source.  Then the ratfor is
run and another sspp is run to select machine dependancies in
fortran.  The strings "-/*HPUX" and "-HPUX*/" are the generic comment 
separators for c source for machine HPUX, "-#HPUX" is for ratfor, 
and "-cHPUX" is for fortran.  The make can be done on any machine by 
setting a variable such as "MCHINE" to the target machine.  The use 
of two passes of sspp allows differences between ratfor and fortran 
to be selected.  For each string, the string is selected to begin 
with the character sequence (after the dash) to indicate comment, so 
if that string is not selected and deleted by sspp, the succeeding 
compilation will pass by the line.

  make MCHINE='"-/*HPUX" "-HPUX*/" "-#HPUX" "-cHPUX"'
	get  -p s.program.r >program.x
	sspp "-/*HPUX" "-HPUX*/" "-#HPUX" "-cHPUX" program.x > program.r
	rm -f program.x 
	ratfor -6% -C program.r > program.x
	sspp "-/*HPUX" "-HPUX*/" "-#HPUX" "-cHPUX" program.x >../debug/program.f
	rm -f program.x 
	f77 -C -c ../debug/program.f
	rm -f program.r

However, it is now better to use the -r, -c or -f options (added in
2/90), so that the above example would be:

  make MCHINE=HPUX
	get  -p s.program.r >program.x
	sspp -r -HPUX program.x > program.r
	rm -f program.x 
	ratfor -6% -C program.r > program.x
	sspp -f -HPUX program.x >../debug/program.f
	rm -f program.x 
	f77 -C -c ../debug/program.f
	rm -f program.r

Usually it is not neccessary to sspp both the ratfor and fortran,
but only the ratfor.
